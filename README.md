# Rentalverse

Rentalverse is a full stack web application designed and developed to help individuals and small real estate investment firms manage their rental properties. This is a unique individual project that I created from the ground up. The inspiration for this project came from my knowledge gained in my previous work experiences. I will be continuously working on this project to build out more complex features. A demo account has been set up, just visit the site and click **Sign in** .

# Data to Input for Demo Purposes

To make things easier, here's some property and tenant data below to use on the **Add A New Property Form** and **Lease Details Form**, respectively, in order to demo the web application. Alternatively, please feel free to manually input any data of your choosing. You can get stock images of properties from the following website: https://www.istockphoto.com/search/2/image?family=creative&phrase=home%20exterior

Right click on an image of a property, click **Copy Image Address**, and paste it into the add a new property form's **Image** field.

Sync and seed your database by running `npm run seed`. In the project directory run `npm run start:dev` and visit http://localhost:8080/ in your web browser to view the project.

# What's Next?

I need to update the database schema to allow for more features to be added. Features such as a user's ability to track maintenance requests and monthly rent payments of each property. The front end styling needs to be improved, along with accessibility. I will be working through these different features and tracking upcoming features in the Nice-To-Have section below.

# Nice-To-Have Features (not an inclusive list)

- Allow a user to input maintenance requests by property and track progress as maintenance is carried out; i.e. Pending, In Progress, Completed
- Allow a user to keep track of rent payments and when they were made for each property. Show total rental income data
- Add validations and prompts on the front end to visually inform a user when an event occurs
- Allow a user to to edit their account information; i.e. avatar, email, password etc.
